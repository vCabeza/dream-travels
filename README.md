# Dream Travels

## Components

I have developed this project without using any external UI libraries to showcase my ability to build components from scratch. This approach allows you to assess my skills in structuring, styling, and handling component logic without relying on pre-built solutions

## Tests

Additionally, every component and page in the project includes its own tests to ensure functionality and maintainability. The test coverage reaches 98%.

## Usage
npm run start
